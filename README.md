# XLink Kai Releases
Think of this repo as a mirror of our offical releases.

## How to install XLink Kai
For macOS and Windows it is simple, download the version you desire from the [releases](https://github.com/Team-XLink/Releases/releases) page.

### macOS
Open the **XLink Kai 7.4.x.dmg** file and copy the **XLink Kai.app** file into your **/Applications** folder. You will also need to install ChmodBPF too which comes with the download, install that and then launch XLink Kai.

### Windows
Open the **XLink Kai 7.4.x.msi** (or **XLink Kai 7.4.x.exe**) file and run through the installation. If you don't use have PSSDK installed, the installer will automatically install this for you.

### Linux (Debian)
We now officially have a repository you can use to install and update XLink Kai with. Please visit [repo.teamxlink.co.uk](https://repo.teamxlink.co.uk) to get started.
